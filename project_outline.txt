Project Outline

1. Business Understanding

A real estate developer focusing on 3D printed houses asked us to help them 
identify areas in Seattle for them to buy cheap old houses for them to knock down 
to build their 3D printed houses. 

They are looking to buy houses between 1600 and 2600 sqft.

Model home serves 2 purposes 

a. Identify areas and characteristics for homes so they can buy.

What are we trying to answer?


2. Data Understanding

First looking at the data.
What data do we have? What columns are useful or not?
What can we add to it to make it more useful? New columns etc.

3. Data Preparation

Data Cleaning. Handling missing values. Dropping columns. Merging tables.

Exploratory data analysis.
Correlations, distributions, categorical values. different prices across zipcodes.
Scatter plots of price across different variables (square footage, etc.)

Building model
Setting a baseline model (simple linear regression)

4. Evaluation

Writing out our Understanding and performance of the model. 
What changes could be made to make it better.
Calculating R-squared, MSE, RMSE, etc. 

5. Deployment

FINAL PRESENTATION!

Deliverables/Recommendations
1. Focus on cheaper zipcodes in order to keep the price down.
2. For 1600 and 2600 square foot houses, they should focus on fair, low average, 
and average size homes because the sizes of those houses are more available in those grades.
Those grades are the cheapest for the availability.
3. Waterfront properties are
