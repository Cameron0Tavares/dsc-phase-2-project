Correlations, distributions, categorical values. different prices across zipcodes.
Scatter plots of price across different variables (square footage, etc.)

Building model
Setting a baseline model (simple linear regression)

4. Evaluation

Writing out our Understanding and performance of the model. 
What changes could be made to make it better.
Calculating R-squared, MSE, RMSE, etc. 

5. Deployment
